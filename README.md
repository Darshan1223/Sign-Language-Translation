# Sign Language Translation Using Random Forest Classifier

Welcome to the Sign Language Translation project! This repository contains code and resources for translating sign language gestures into readable text using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The goal of this project is to bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities by leveraging machine learning.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** for recognizing and translating hand gestures captured from images or video frames into corresponding text. The system can process sign language inputs, extract key features from the gestures, and classify them into the appropriate symbols or words.

### Features
- **Hand Gesture Detection:** Capture and preprocess hand gestures from images or video streams.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract meaningful features using image processing techniques like contour detection, keypoints, etc.
- **Sign Classification:** Classify gestures into sign language characters or words using a Random Forest Classifier.
- **Real-Time Translation:** Translate sign language into readable text in real-time.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: We begin by collecting a dataset of sign language gestures. These gestures can be images or video frames depicting various signs.
2. **Preprocessing**: The images are preprocessed, and features such as contours, angles, and keypoints are extracted from the hand gestures.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the extracted features to learn the patterns of different gestures.
4. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained, it can classify new gestures and output the corresponding text translation.

## 🔧 Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-translation.git
   cd sign-language-translation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the preprocessing and training scripts**:

   You can explore the notebooks under the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess the data and train the model.

4. **Make Predictions**:

   Use the trained Random Forest model for making predictions on new gestures. Run the prediction script:

   ```bash
   python src/classifier.py --image path/to/gesture_image.jpg
   ```

## 📊 Model Performance

The model was trained on a dataset of [number] hand gestures representing [number] unique sign language symbols. Below are the model’s key performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 98%

## 🔍 Future Improvements

Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Adding more robust image augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Extending the model to recognize more complex phrases and sentences.
- Integrating with a real-time camera feed for live sign language interpretation.
- Exploring deep learning models like CNNs for improved accuracy.
